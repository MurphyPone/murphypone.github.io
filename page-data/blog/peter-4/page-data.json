We can now go\ninto that notion a little more deeply, and see it from another perspective. The word\n\"isomorphism' applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in\nsuch a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part in the other\nstructure, where \"corresponding\" means that the two part play similar roles in their\nrespective structures. This usage of the word \"isomorphism\" is derived from a more\nprecise notion in mathematics.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can use isomorphisms to formulaically crank out Terrible Turing Machines!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take one complex structure to be a Turing Machine,</li>\n<li>Take a second complex structure to be absurdly disparate from Turing Machines,</li>\n<li>Do some grunt-work of asserting the isomorphic relationship between the two structs,</li>\n<li>Describe why you've done a terrible thing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's Try it Out!</p>\n<h1>Wood Peckers are Bad Turing Machines</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>Structure A</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Turing Machine</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {Structure A} = \\text {Turing Machine}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Structure A</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Turing Machine</span></span></span></span></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>Structure B</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Wood Peckers</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {Structure B} = \\text {Wood Peckers}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Structure B</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Wood Peckers</span></span></span></span></span></li>\n<li>The eponymous drumming performed by woodpeckers is a non-vocal method of communication utilized by several members of the Picidae family.   Ornithology tells us that each species of woodpecker exhibits a unique pattern and frequency of wood pecking that the fowl use to court females and establish loose territorial boundaries.  Although their name presupposes \"wood\" to be the material of choice, these birds are by no means precluded from head banging your gutter or any other percussive structure they deem fit.  Because woodpeckers' concussive efforts emit a predictable, measurable, and intentional noise, we, as third-party observers, could assign arbitrary values to the drumming patterns performed.  If we could establish \"code\" as simple as binary (which is implicit to nearly any isomorphic pattern we will identify: things are either happening, or they are not.  A truly impressive code.), we could imitate the behavior of a Turing Machine according to the drumming of the woodpecker - the efficacy of which would be improved in relation to the complexity of the \"language\" we develop/translate the pecking into.</li>\n<li>This is obviously a terrible idea as we bear little-to-no control or means of communication with woodpeckers.  Therefore, the processes undertaken by this isomorphic Turing Machine would be quite erratic.  What a Terrible Turing Machine!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/HDqF9Tnw4IZNe/giphy.gif\" alt=\"wp\">     </p>\n<p>This Terrible Turing Idea was brought to you by Patrick Riley.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"21 June, 2019","path":"/blog/peter-4","title":"Terrible Turing Machines - 04","author":"Peter M."},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
