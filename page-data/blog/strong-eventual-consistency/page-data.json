My GPA</h1>\n<p>(The Byzantine Problem)</p>\n<p>In distributed systems striving for <a class=\"eventually\">eventual</a> consistency (definition forthcoming), The Byzantine Problem is an analogy describing the need for a resolution protocol for imperfect information or component failure.  Oftentimes, such protocols rely on consensus voting, proof of work, or prioritization of \"leading\" <em>trustworthy</em> nodes in the system.  </p>\n<p>A compromised component in a distributed system can stochastically exhibit symptoms of success and failure in completing whatever the distributed task is.  A <em>distributed task</em> might be something along the lines of tallying views on a YouTube video,<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> a simple fork-join task, or coordination of battle strategy against Ottoman combatants.</p>\n<p>This presents the problem of isolating, or at the very least <em>mitigating</em>, the spread of compromised information to the rest of the system, and this introduces the measure of severity of such a breach to a system's integrity: <strong>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</strong> – the resilience of a system on the whole to such conditions.</p>\n<p>In the titular metaphor, a group of generals must come to a consensus about whether to attack or to retreat.  Each component of the distributed system (commonly referred to as a <strong>replica</strong> in the literature) may have its own strategic preference or signal (in this example, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">A</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{A}ttack</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">A</span></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">a</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">c</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03148em;\">k</span></span></span></span> or <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{R}etreat</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68611em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">R</span></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">e</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">e</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">a</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">t</span></span></span></span> - though signals need not be binary in general).  To establish urgency in our hypothetical, we assume that a coordinated attack or retreat by all the generals (the system on the whole) is favorable to a fractured mobilization as the result of miscommunication, where each general acts according to their own strategy rather than that of the whole army.</p>\n<p>To complicate the situation, some generals may be selectively treacherous (probabilistically, intentionally, etc.  The Internet is a big place, and lots can go wrong), sending signal <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">A</span></span></span></span> to some partition of their confederates, and signal <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68611em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">R</span></span></span></span></span> to the others in an attempt to sew chaos on behalf of the Turks. </p>\n<p>Additionally, as the army is physically separated (<em>distributed</em>) the integrity of their messages is at the whim of their messengers.  Messengers can be bribed, intercepted, or be UDP packets: they might not correctly reflect the intent of the sender, nor even be received.  Worse yet, they might not be <em>consistent</em> in their success or failures, making this a <em>Byzantine</em> problem.</p>\n<h2>Words That Rhyme with Different, Etc.</h2>\n<p>(Characteristics of Byzantine Problems)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Byzantine Fault</strong> occurs if any component in the system presents different symptoms to different observers.</li>\n<li>A <strong>Byzantine Failure</strong> occurs if a system on the whole is compromised due to Byzantine Faults in a system where consensus is required.</li>\n<li>A <strong>Byztantine Fault Tolerance</strong> is achieved if non-faulty components have a majority agreement on strategy (or whatever the subject of consensus is).  \"Majority,\" here, is also loosely defined.

Instead we have this \"simple, theoretically sound approach,\" covered at length in the original 2011 paper by Shapiro et al: \"A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types.\"<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>  CRDTs in general aim to do away with the need for reaching consensus.  In doing so, they indirectly address the Byzantine Problem by defining a protocol for <em>offline, stateful consensus</em>.  </p>\n<p>In the offline scenarios specifically, if attempts are made to talk off-machine, we want to enqueue outbound messages and give responses deadlines rather than throwing an exception wherever possible.  In the case where we cannot adhere to this rule, we need to gracefully handle the offline scenario. E.g., when talking to a centralized authorization service, a user may be locked out if we (acting as the Auth Service) can't verify their security access permissions due to a network outage.  Once we are again able to verify their requisite permissions, and a validity window for the answer, we should cache the response to prevent a lapse in availability for them in the future.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/crdt-1.png\"></p>\n<p>It is not possible to come to consensus with a system that cannot be communicated with.  Even under a resolution protocol which uses default null values for missing votes as would be the case for outbound messages in the above offline example, only one side of the partition can be in the majority (Servers A and B), and the minority does not want to <em>lose</em> its state outright.</p>\n<p>It is fruitless to strive for agreement in such scenarios, but a consistent view of the past with distributed conflict resolution is achievable.  </p>\n<p>A protocol like Paxos for achieving consensus involves seeking a majority vote of a <em>leader</em>, and voting on the next move that the state machine is to take.  On the event of a hopefully-exceptional network partition, updates propagating across the network need to terminate in the minority partition (Server C), lest the state be lost when the partition (hopefully) heals.</p>\n<p>There are numerous drawbacks to this framework, the most obvious being the assumption that partitions are infrequent and/or brief.</p>\n<h2>dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 4</h2>\n<p>(Types of CRDTs)</p>\n<p>According to the seminal paper, for replicas to return the same result for all query operations after such a partition is introduced, two conditions must be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>safety</strong>: If the causal history of replicas <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">i</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">j</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.85396em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05724em;\">j</span></span></span></span> is the same, the abstract state of these replicas must be equivalent</li>\n<li><strong>liveness</strong>: If some element <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">e</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">e</span></span></span></span> is in the causal history of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.65952em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">i</span></span></span></span>, then it will <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a> be in the causal history of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">j</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.85396em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05724em;\">j</span></span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inductively, the pairwise <a class=\"eventually\">eventual</a> consistency defined by these two properties guarantees convergence for any non-empty subset of replicas contingent on the <a class=\"eventually\">eventual</a> receipt of all updates.</p>\n<h2>Fuck, Dantooine Is Big</h2>\n<p>(Example of a CRDT)</p>\n<p>Suppose we have several servers spread across the world – in warzones, hotbeds of natural disaster, and other areas prone to network outages like my mom's basement whenever I hop on the sticks in Warzone: say Aleppo, Abescon, and Alexandria.</p>\n<p>We have the simple task of utmost importance: track the highest value observed by any of the severs (my killstreak 😤 😤) across our shared database.

In the prior example, the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">max(\\cdot)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">m</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">a</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">x</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">⋅</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> function is a literal LUB, but our data will usually have a more complex structure than singular numbers.  </p>\n<p>Formally, our set of data values together within a LUB-based partial order function forms a <em>join semilattice</em><sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup> where the \"join\" is a property of the LUB which governs how the lattices may be merged.  If values only ever increase, the lattice is monotonic, and said to be a CRDT.  A LUB can be thought of as the <em>closest common ancestor</em> of two elements in a hierarchical collection of some sort.</p>\n<h2>Vanilla-Scented Laser Beams</h2>\n<p>(Operation-Based CRDTs)</p>\n<p>This variety of object assumes a channel which maintains a linear ordering of message delivery to communicate between replicas.  Operations <em><strong>outside</strong></em> of this delivery order are called \"concurrent,\" and if they are commutative, than all operations consistent with the order of the deliver channel are equivalent, so the distributed state will be convergent across all replicas. </p>\n<h2>Hey Ken, Someone Methodically Mushed the Donuts</h2>\n<p>(Nuff Bout CRDTs – this would be an interlude)</p>\n<p>CRDTs avoid the need for consensus by instead relying on definitions for behavior in light of conflicting observations.  </p>\n<p>It's feasible to due away with git merge conflicts entirely if the version control system is treated as a CRDT with some rule which enforces a Least Upper Bound on the commit history.  For example, simply take the most recent provided timestamp of each conflicting event to be the \"maximum.\"  This obviously doesn't work in practice, but it's possible.</p>\n<h1>Umbrellas and Beersocks</h1>\n<p>(The FLP Theorem)</p>\n<p>Before diving into the advancements offered by HashGraphs, it's first worthwhile to survey problems of distributed consensus and pickup some useful terminology.  The most relevant to the discussion about HashGraphs which <em>do</em> rely on consensus (<em>sort of</em>) being the eponymous Fischer-Lynch-Paterson Theorem introduced in \"Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process.\"<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup> </p>\n<p>The problem the authors present is that getting reliable, asynchronous processes –amidst some faulty ones– to agree on <em>even just one</em> binary value is very hard.  They note that every protocol in this asynchronous case can be a victim of possible nontermination with <em>even just one</em> faulty process.</p>\n<p>The example problem instance they use is referred to as the \"transaction commit problem\" for a distributed database which is roughly similar to the aforementioned git merge conflict problem: all the database managers that have participated in processing a transaction must agree on whether or not to accept the transaction's results on the database.  </p>\n<p>Whatever decision is made must be executed by all managers in order to maintain consistency across the replicas i.e. <em>consensus must be reached</em>.  If all of the managers are reliable, then the solution is trivial.  However, even <strong>non</strong>-Byzantine faults such as crashes, network partitions or outright failures, lost, distorted, and/or duplicate messages present problems for the trivial (arguably <em>naive</em>) scenario where replicas trust one another.  </p>\n<p>The titular crux of the paper is that <strong>no completely asynchronous protocol can tolerate even a single unannounced process death</strong>.  This constraint is so overbearing that the authors don't even grapple with the Byzantine complications, and further assume reliable message channels.  They make these nifty assumptions to show the fragility of distributed systems in general, conversely making their main theorem as widely applicable and robust as possible. </p>\n<p>The asynchronicity of the systems being considered is also integral to their asserted fragility. No assumptions are made about relative speeds of processes, or delays in their receipt.  Processes don't have access to a universal, synchronized clock, so timeout-based algorithms are not applicable.  Therefore, process death is indistinguishable from a slow process or high network latency.  </p>\n<h2>Thrashville 1/3</h2>\n<p>(Model)</p>\n<p><strong>Processes</strong> are state machines with potentially infinitely many states which communicate via messages sent between each other.  In one discrete time step, a process may attempt to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempt to receive a message by performing a local computation as to whether an message was delivered to it </li>\n<li>Send arbitrarily finite amounts of messages to other processes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any truthy processes receive the message, then via an assumed <em>atomic broadcast capability</em> (from the generous assumption of a reliable communication channel), all truthy processes <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a> will too.  In other words, every message is <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a> delivered as long as the other processes make sufficiently infinite attempts to receive it. </p>\n<p>There's some lore on the matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The asynchronous commit protocols in current use all seem to have a “window of vulnerability”- an interval of time during the execution of the algorithm in which the delay or inaccessibility of a single process can cause the entire algorithm to wait indefinitely. It follows from our impossibility result that every commit protocol has such a “window,” confirming a widely believed tenet in the folklore. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>Consensus

(demo)</h1>\n<p>(Swirlds HashGraph – AKA <em>Solving the Problem in Practice</em>)</p>\n<p>With the FLP Theorem in our back pocket, we are ready to confront the HashGraph approach to achieving fair, fast and Byzantine-Fault-tolerant conensus developed by Swirlds.  The distributed S/PaaS company published their white paper including proofs of the fault-tolerance of their HashGraph approach in 2016,<sup id=\"fnref-9\"><a href=\"#fn-9\" class=\"footnote-ref\">9</a></sup> and hot dayum it seems pretty cool.    </p>\n<p>The abstract claims that their proposal for a new kind of replicated state machine</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>achieves <em>fairness</em>, in the sense that it is difficult for an attacker to manipulate which of two transactions will be chosen to be first in the consensus order. It has complete asynchrony, no leaders, no round robin, no proof-of work, <a class=\"eventually\">eventual</a> consensus with probability one, and high speed in the absence of faults. It is based on a gossip protocol, in which the participants don’t just gossip about transactions. They <em>gossip about gossip</em>. They jointly build a <em>hashgraph</em> reflecting all of the gossip events. This allows Byzantine agreement to be achieved through <em>virtual voting</em>. Alice does not send Bob a vote over the Internet. Instead, Bob calculates what vote Alice would have sent, based on his knowledge of what Alice knows. This yields fair Byzantine agreement on a total order for all transactions, with very little communication overhead beyond the transactions themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas the authors of the FLP theorem offered generous assumptions about the <em>friendliness</em> of the system at play, Swirlds assumes the opposite: that the system and its external conditions be as hostile as possible. The rhetorical purpose being the same – to prove the most robust form of applicability and/or correctness as possible.  They use a <em>strong</em> definition of \"Byzantine\" to mean that just under <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1/3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span><span class=\"mord\">3</span></span></span></span> of all components within the system can be adversaries colluding with one another, deleting or corrupting or delaying messages, who also can have <strong>full control of the network</strong> (and thus, the communication channel) with the same caveat offered by the FLP theorem, <em>that if a truthy component infinitely attempts to send a message to another component, it must be received <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a></em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The system is totally asynchronous. It is assumed that for any honest members Alice and Bob, Alice will <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a> try to sync with Bob, and if Alice repeatedly tries to send Bob a message, she will <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a> succeed. No other assumptions are made about network reliability or network speed or timeout periods. Specifically, the attacker is allowed to completely control the network, deleting and delaying messages arbitrarily, subject to the constraint that a message between honest members that is sent repeatedly must <a class=\"eventually\">eventually</a> have a copy of it get through.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In spite of the FLP theorem above, the authors assert that their completely asynchronous, nondeterministic HashGraph achieves consensus with a probability of 1.</p>\n<p>They acknowledge other consensus algorithms like proof of work blockchains, and leader-based voting, as well as other Byzantine protocols which attempt to address the pitfalls of the former two, and point out that even the lattermost approaches require up to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O(n^3)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.064108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">n</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> message exchanges to achieve consensus.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HashGraph sends no votes at all over the network, because all voting is virtual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Welcome to Castle Irwell</h2>\n<p>(Core Mechanisms)</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that a HashGraph is a Graph of Hashes, and not the other way round: something akin to a HashMap of Graphs, though that's also fun to think about.

This uses very little bandwidth overhead beyond simply gossiping the events alone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A member such as Alice will choose another member at random, such as Bob, and then Alice will tell Bob all of the information she knows so far. Alice then repeats with a different random member. Bob repeatedly does the same, and all other members do the same. In this way, if a single member becomes aware of new information, it will spread <em>exponentially fast</em> through the community until every member is aware of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gossiping a hashgraph gives the participants a great deal of information. If a new transaction is placed in the payload of an event, it will quickly spread to all members, until every member knows it. Alice will learn of the transaction. And she will know exactly when Bob learned of the transaction. And she will know exactly when Carol learned of the fact that Bob had learned of that transaction.  Deep chains of such reasoning become possible when all members have a copy of the hashgraph. As the hashgraph grows upward, the different members may have slightly different subsets of the new events near the top, but they will quickly converge to having exactly the same events lower down in the hashgraph. Furthermore, if Alice and Bob happen to both have a given event, then they are guaranteed to also both have all its ancestors. And they will agree on all the edges in the subgraph of those ancestors. All of this allows powerful algorithms to run locally, including for Byzantine fault tolerance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gossip about gossip requires little overhead communication (compared to gossip about the transactions themselves) as components comunicate only the diffs of their signatures of observing new transactions.  Even these signatures can be compressed: \"With appropriate compression, this can be sent in very few bytes, adding only a few percent to the size of the message being sent.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Meet Me in Montauk</h3>\n<p>(Virtual Voting)</p>\n<p>Every member has a/is a copy of the HashGraph, so Alice can compute what Bob <em>would have</em> sent her, if they had been adhering to a traditional Byzantine consensus protocol which required vote-sending.  Every member can reach  agreement on any number of decisions, without a single vote ever being sent. The HashGraph alone is sufficient. So zero bandwidth is used, beyond simply gossiping the HashGraph.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Virtual voting has several benefits. In addition to saving bandwidth, it ensures that members always calculate their votes according to the rules. If Alice is honest, she will calculate virtual votes for the virtual Bob that are honest. Even if the real Bob is a cheater, he cannot attack Alice by making the virtual Bob vote incorrectly</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Lemma: <em>For any single YES/NO question, consensus is achieved <a

witness to be <strong>famous</strong> if the hashgraph shows that most members received it fairly soon after it was created. Then it’s sufficient to run the Byzantine agreement protocol only for witnesses, deciding for each witness the single question “is this witness famous?” Once Byzantine agreement is reached on the exact set of famous witnesses, it is easy to derive from the hashgraph a fair total order for all events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Shred Cruz?</h3>\n<p>(Seeing and Strongly Seeing)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An event <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">x</span></span></span></span> can <strong>see</strong> event <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span></span></span></span> if <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span></span></span></span> is an ancestor of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">x</span></span></span></span>, and the ancestors of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">x</span></span></span></span> do not include a fork by the creator of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span></span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/crdt-14.png\"></p>\n<p>Imagine if I had the patience to make an interactive graph for this.

that it should be difficult for a small group of attackers to unfairly influence the order of transactions chosen as the consensus, and that the order of transactions needs to be preserved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For some applications, the exact order does not matter, but for a stock market it can be critically important that this decision be made fairly.<sup id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\" class=\"footnote-ref\">11</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted, an inherent flaw with the leader-reliant algorithms such as those of Paxos or Raft is that –regardless of the means used to select a hopefully-truthy leader– that component becomes a single point of failure, and therefore an easy target.<sup id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\" class=\"footnote-ref\">12</a></sup> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In any case, the leader could arbitrarily decide to ignore Alice or Bob's reported transactions for a period of time, delaying one of them, to force one transaction to come after another.  If the goal is distributed trust, <em>then no single individual can be trusted</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, given the nature of consensus needing to be reached by at least <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2n/3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">n</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span><span class=\"mord\">3</span></span></span></span> witnesses in a round, the structure of the HashGraph acts as a deterrent to attacks predicated on slowing the network. Failures resulting from (real) \"total control\" over the network are not considered as flaws of the protocol:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Byzantine proofs assume the attackers control the internet, and can delay arbitrary messages. If attackers actually had that power, they could simply disconnect Alice from the internet for as long as it takes for Bob to send a transaction and have it recorded. This could be done on the real internet by launching a denial of service attack, flooding every computer with packets from Bob in an attempt to prevent Alice from communicating. Of course, this would also be effective if Alice were communicating with a central server, so it could be considered <strong>more a failure of the internet than a failure of the consensus system.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/crdt-4.png\"></p>\n<h3>(Amateur Cartography)</h3>\n<p>Fastness (A HashGraph has 99 pace)</p>\n<p>Throughout the paper, the authors provide ample discussion for means of compression or further reducing the overhead of the HashGraph without ever compromising the correctness of the structure on the whole.</p>\n<p>The concern for overhead is almost humorously gratuitous.  The priority for performative resolution of Byzantine problems is highlighted by the discussion of packing witnesses and visibility vectors into a single integer for optimal ALU consumption.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/crdt-5.png\"></p>\n<h4>Naruto Themed Sexting</h4>\n<p>(Example of How it Works)</p>\n<p>First, we start with the initial states for a HashGraph with four members.
