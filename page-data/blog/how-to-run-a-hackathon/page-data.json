Most companies have a more flexible budget at the start of a quarter rather than the end.  Additionally, the winter holiday season (spanning from Thanksgiving through to the New Year) is effectively a dead zone as far as cold-call/email responses go.   </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cold Calls / Emails</strong> - this tends to be the primary avenue for gaining sponsorship, especially for younger events.  This process (and the whole sponsorship effort) can be broken down into the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Contact</strong> following a generic template that has been tailored to specific companies sent from personal emails to avoid spam filters - <a href=\"#template_email\">see example below</a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Two-ish follow-up emails at regular <em>professional</em> intervals if you don't hear back at first</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The Pitch</strong> - If a company expresses interest in your event, your goal is to schedule a phone call to further discuss the benefits of a partnership, and send them the prospectus so that they have an idea of what price points are</li>\n<li>STRESS that these numbers are just loose guidelines and that your team is flexible and <em>wants</em> a partnership with them</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The Prospectus shouldn't be the end-all be all, it's merely the jumping-off point for negotiations to establish a ~long-lasting partnership~  </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Confirmation</strong> - includes the invoice for the agreed upon amount if step 2 went well</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-event \"Concierge\"</strong> - a week or two prior to the event, the point of contact with said sponsor should send a warm email re-iterating how they can maximize their presence and experience at the event, letting them know that they will be their personal contact if they have any questions during the event, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>This person should also welcome them at the venue and get them settled at the table/generally make them feel at home.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Using Your Network</strong> - make use of LinkedIn, school career fairs, friends, school partners, anyone who might be interested</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Call</strong> - If you are able to schedule a call with a potential sponsor, the following script has proven to be successful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Hi, thanks for being available to talk\"</li>\n<li>Info about event</li>\n<li>Info about yourself and role in the event</li>\n<li>\n<p>ASK about their goals, recruiting objectives, desired skill sets, products/services they're looking to introduce; what would they like to get out of a partnership with your event?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based off their response, pitch them the prospectus tier that most similarly aligns with goals</li>\n<li>Be flexible within reason, and don't be afraid to turn down unreasonable negotiations and companies as a whole - remember that your #1 priority is the participants, don't forfeit the integrity of your event's purpose for a sponsor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The Prospectus</strong> - Generally speaking, a simple prospectus formula is as follows (with more creative, on-brand names):</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tier</th>\n<th>Formula</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower</td>\n<td>one-off items: stickers, a meal \"presented by x\", swag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>U</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>G</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">BUDGET /</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">D</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">G</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span></span></span></span>NUM_EXPECTED_SPONSORS / 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mid</td>\n<td><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>U</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>G</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">BUDGET /</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">D</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">G</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span></span></span></span>NUM_EXPECTED_SPONSORS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>U</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>G</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">BUDGET /</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">D</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">G</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span></span></span></span>NUM_EXPECTED_SPONSORS x 2.5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>  <a name=\"template_email\"></a></p>\n<h2>Template Sponsorship Email</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi <code class=\"language-text\">#CONTACT_NAME</code>,</p>\n<p><strong>[[If a sponsor from a previous year]]</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, the <code class=\"language-text\">$EVENT_NAME</code> team would like to thank <code class=\"language-text\">$COMPANY_NAME</code> for their generous contributions towards making <code class=\"language-text\">$EVENT_NAME</code> successful in the past.

In order to prevent this measure, encourage hackers to register their domains earlier in the event (most still won‚Äôt).  Most teams register a domain after they‚Äôve completed their main project to serve as a landing page, which usually happens in 3-5 hour window before project submission and creates a bottleneck.
