Famous in his own life, the illustrative genius pioneered an entire genre of entertainment focused on <em>pursuing the most roundabout or unnecessarily difficult means of achieving something</em>.    </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.mousetrapcontraptions.com/rube-wifes_letter.jpg\" alt=\"RGM\"></p>\n<p>Before we become overwhelmed by the isomorphic rabbit hole which beckons us from the crest of next week, I thought that it would be fun to momentarily diverge from and indulge in a sillier Thuring Thought experimenth.</p>\n<h1>The Machine</h1>\n<p>The year is 1955.</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>Suppose </mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {Suppose }</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Suppose </span></span></span></span></span> that a tennis ball rests atop a hill looking down upon rural San Francisco.  A gust of wind rocks the ball forward, ever so slightly, causing a single domino to topple over.  Immediately adjacent to the falling domino lies another, and another, and another!  Spiraling all the way down the hill, dominoes coil around the underbrush, constricting the non-Turing Complete organic matter.  For twenty-two and a quarter days, the dominoes clink into one another.  And only once did the next domino not fall over when it was supposed to causing our unnamed observer to dash from his cover and resume the process!</p>\n<p>Once the last domino topples over barrier separating desolate soil from smoothly paved concrete, it lands on a scale, attached to which is a string stretching upwards and over a house, through a complex pulley system that has been fully containerized such that if the string breaks free from any one pulley, another will immediately get shuffled into place to catch it.  </p>\n<p>After the domino comes to rest on the scale, the rope is tugged just enough to cause a thunderous <strong><em>T W A N G</em></strong> that be heard from the back yard.  As our third-party observer scrambles to race around to the back, more mechanical whirring and clicking can be heard as a tesseract of levers, string-pulley systems, dominos, actual bells &#x26; whistles, and catapults manufactured out of commonplace silverware.</p>\n<p>It is a scene of chaos as glasses of colored liquid are toppled into miniature pipelines, ball bearings race each other down tracks - displacing hammers, that were balanced perfectly upright, into downward trajectories to continue the domino effect.  With each motion, another is set into place.  </p>\n<p>The observer is prepared to make a pseudo-big-brain assessment about the potential for isomorphic mappings of the mechanical behemoth that has been hidden in the backyard of who he can only assume to be Mr. Rube Goldberg himself.  However the observer is naive and STUPID STUPID STUPID - BHoag is almighty, and BHoag knew the observer would be so foolish as to make such an irrational assumption.  No, it <em>cannot</em> be isomorophically mapped to a Turing Machine, or maybe it can, who cares?!  Instead, the final domino tips off a ledge, landing on a trigger pad which ignites the fuse of a canon aimed directly at Rube's backdoor.  </p>\n<p>At this very moment, Rube Goldberg emerges out the back entrance, visibly perplexed and awestruck by the simultaneous beautiful and Lovecraftian monstrosity that is the machine erected in his backyard.  The canon fires!  A net lined with weights shoots out at the now-aged man bringing him to the ground - immobilized.  BHoag walks over him, attaching a rope to the tangle of nets that now entraps him.  </p>\n<p><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>“You’re being kidnapped,&quot;</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {``You&#x27;re being kidnapped,&quot;}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">“You’re being kidnapped,&quot;</span></span></span></span></span> BHoag surreptitiously snarls at the inventor.  </p>\n<p><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>“You’re going to make me a Turing Machine, or I’ll force you to write in LaTeX for the rest of your life.&quot;</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {``You&#x27;re going to make me a Turing Machine, or I&#x27;ll force you to write in LaTeX for the rest of your life.&quot;}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">“You’re going to make me a Turing Machine, or I’ll force you to write in LaTeX for the rest of your life.&quot;</span></span></span></span></span>  The old man surrenders, and produces a Turing Machine, bending to the will of BHoag and creating a Terrible Turing Machine under truly Terrible circumstances.    </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-12/256/disappointed-face.png\">  </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"22 June, 2019","path":"/blog/peter-5","title":"Terrible Turing Machines - 05","author":"Peter M."},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"4 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
