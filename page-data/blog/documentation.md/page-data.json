Metrics are hugely important throughout the entire development process, but especially in documentation as tracking open vs. resolved issues is a powerful means of evaluating progress and achievement.</p>\n<h2>Readability</h2>\n<p>Additionally, the quality of documentation can be evaluated in terms of readability according to several standards such as Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning-fog, and Dale-Chall formulas.  The target readability level hovers around the 5th-grade reading level, should be succinct and avoids use of jargon without clear definitions/detracting from the focus of the topic at hand.  Readability also contributes to SEO.</p>\n<h2>How to Follow the Process</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a ticket/issue and tag a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to oversee your progress - this makes your task trackable</li>\n<li>Define terms, establish dependencies, and identify areas of ambiguity</li>\n<li>Write content with readability and audience in mind</li>\n<li>Review / QA (via SME/PoC)</li>\n<li>Merge and close ticket</li>\n<li>Deliver</li>\n<li>Deploy</li>\n<li>Reject / repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There should always be at least one Point of Contact who can verify/provide oversight on a given issue.</p>\n<h2>Audience</h2>\n<p>Obviously, identifying the audience of your documentation depends on what problem you're solving/what you're documenting.  Directions as to how you would put on shoes varies between a 2 year old and a 20 year old.  I can assume that the 20 year old knows how to install shoes.</p>\n<h2>Planning</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Amount*</th>\n<th>Time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Original Content</td>\n<td>1-3 pages/hr</td>\n<td>25-750 words/hr</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refactoring, Restructuring, Editing</td>\n<td>1-6 pages/hr</td>\n<td>250-1,500 words/hr</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Formatting</td>\n<td>2-5 pages/hr</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Basic Copyedit</td>\n<td>5-10 pages/hr</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proof Reading</td>\n<td>9-13 pages/hr</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* Data from the Editorial Freelance Association on general documentation, not necessarily technical docs.  Thank God.</p>\n<p>When reading other issues and writing your own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tag relevant people</li>\n<li>Over communicate, ON THE ISSUE/TICKET, rather than undercommunicate secretly (e.g. private slack, email that gets lost, sticky note)</li>\n<li>Comment of anything is unclear</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interviewing SMEs</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/0/08/Mr._Smee_Transparent/revision/latest?cb=20170713193443\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>From an interns perspective, SMEs could knock out any task you get assigned for a month in a day. Their time is valuable, which is why you write the docs, and they reinvent clocks.  If you manage to pin one of them down for a meeting time, it's important to clarify your problem and domain of knowledge as quickly and clearly as possible.  Some questions that can optimize the time you get with them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What existing, relevant sources should I read before starting?</li>\n<li>What is the main use case?</li>\n<li>Who is the intended audience, what level of experience can I assume?</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"17 July, 2019","path":"/blog/documentation.md","title":"Digest: Documentation"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
