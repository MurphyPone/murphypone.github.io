However, the representativeness and availability heuristics can make a conjunction appear more probable than one of its constituents.</p>\n<p><strong>Representativeness Heuristic</strong> - \"the degree to which an event (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population, and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated\".</p>\n<p><strong>Availability Heuristic</strong> - \"The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.\"</p>\n<p>With that in mind, consider the following diagram.  <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>P(q)</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {P(q)}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">P(q)</span></span></span></span></span> is <em>strictly</em> greater than <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>P(p&amp;q)</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text {P(p\\&amp;q)}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">P(p&amp;q)</span></span></span></span></span>.  When graphically presented, this axiom is obvious.  However, when presented verbally - our minds tend to err.  This is because the way that we process stories does not adhere to the laws of statistics and probability.  Adding details to our stories and experiences seems as though it would increase their likelihood, but that is not the case.   </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://inquiryintoinquiry.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/venn-diagram-two-variables-p-q.jpg\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>E.g.:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bill is an accountant</li>\n<li>Bill is an accountant and plays jazz.</li>\n<li>Bill plays jazz.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given Bill's background</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>30 year old, uncreative bachelor.

The bottom row has been included to demonstrate the failures of the three categories of participants to identify the conjunction rule.  Most egregious is the highlighted cell which is particularly troubling insofar as the \"sophisticated\" subject sample consisted of people whose day job involved cognitive statistics, yet <em>still</em> overwhelmingly failed to correctly answer direct-transparent questions including conjunctive fallacies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Naive</th>\n<th>Informed</th>\n<th>Sophisticated</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>indirect</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>direct-subtle</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>direct-transparent</td>\n<td>89-92%</td>\n<td>86-90%</td>\n<td><strong>83-85%</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Solutions discussed in their paper included framing the questions in terms of gambling.  I.e \"If you answer the question correctly, I will give you $10.\"  These prefaces tended to engage the subject's analytical thinking noodles.  When money gets involved, people immediately think in the mode of extensionalism rather than intuitive.  Furthermore, betting is a good medium of conflict resolution as it imposes a tax on bullshit.  I.e. \"I bet $20 i'm right and you are wrong.  Turns out I'm wrong.  Fuck, I'm not going to make that same expensive mistake again.\"  Argue, bet, pay, learn.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"A full understanding of a principle of physics, logic, or statistics requires knowledge of the conditions under which it prevails over conflicting arguments\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>A Note on Heuristics</h3>\n<p>Heuristics are the quick means by which we assess something in the absence to a pen &#x26; paper (i.e. expensive computational logic --> \"Slow Thinking\").  They can be quite useful in rough estimations or snap decisions.  However, they're not always good...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Flying is an order of magnitude safer than driving a car.</li>\n<li>9/11 <em>drastically</em> reduced the amount of flights because of the degree to which the news reported on the attacks.</li>\n<li>\n<h2>Car crash deaths since 2001 far exceed ~3,000 immediately effected lives of 9/11 as well as those who have since passed due to injuries incurred during the attacks or other related causes of death such as cancer from the dust particles inhaled by rescuers and bystanders alike.  <a href=\"https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/\">In fact</a>, \"over 37,000 people die in road crashes each year,\"  in the United States alone.
