It sounds like it’s boring to talk to me, and you don’t want to say that I’m being annoying even when I am.  That it’s tiresome to do so is concerning, and again I don’t know what to tell you… “I’m sorry” is equally dismissive because I don’t really think the lack of communication is entirely my fault.  I am sorry that you feel disconnected, and I do recognize that I’m not doing enough to try to remedy that, but again, I’m at a loss as to what is expected of me other than somehow be more emotionally present than I am.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You should definitely feel as though you can address this kind of thing with me, I just don’t think I’ll have a solution at the ready.     </p>\n<p>I really don’t mean to be be pedantic by asking what I do that comes across as aloof.  Is that what you mean in encouraging me to say what I like/dislike?  Because you really don’t do anything that pisses me off.  Call that agreeable or distant, I suppose…  I would say something if it was upsetting.  I wasn’t going to say anything about you ghosting me since I figured hey, maybe she’s got a lot going on, just isn’t up to it rn, whatever; I’m sure she would/will say something when she cares to.  That contributed to my lack of anything to say when you brought this up, since it was kind of a 180º from the way you’d been acting the past few days.  For what it’s worth, I’m still not upset about it haha, you’ve been straightforward which is appreciable. </p>\n<p>I think one of the things that might have kept me from commenting on anything (still couldn’t name a specific thing you’ve done that’s been irritating) is how independent you present yourself.  The “idgaf” what people think (but in a cool way, not a head-ass way) self-confidence made me figure you were pretty comfortable with yourself and that even if I did want you to change something, you wouldn’t lol. </p>\n<p>I don’t think identifying what one another does that upsets or satiates the other necessitates an emotional connection..  Couldn’t tell you what <em>does</em>, but that seems like a poor basis (although still worthwhile).  I agree we don’t know each other well enough yet –which I think probably contributes moreso than knowing what bothers the other–, and quarantine doesn’t do any favors.  Curious to hear what you have to say.  Sorry it took me all day, been legitimately busy, not blowing you off.<br>\n—</p>\n<p>Talk:\n(Concede) You said you wanted me to think about what I want from being with you \n- (2)\n- I don’t want to lose you though as spending time with you and just talking with you has been one of the only healthy things that I’ve been looking forward to in a long time\n- you’ve also mentioned that I’m just hard to talk to about some things, and I that I need to press you about that sometimes.\n\n- I want to be with you. You are the highlight of my day and I need to tell you that more often.  \nI want to share my experiences with you, the good and the bad. I want us to learn from each other \nand I want to keep being able to vulnerable with you. \n- I also want to hear what you want out of this relationship so that we’re on the same page and so that I don’t let you down as I have been</p>\n<p>(crit) You also said that you wanted to be the best girlfriend that you could so I don’t think it would be unfair for me to introduce my perspective on the matter. And that you’re not mad, but I don’t know if that’s the case\n(1)\n- You obviously feel unfairly shut out and I need to give her credit\n- I’ve never liked to burden other people with my stress. \nI get that you’re more or less receptive of it and would rather that I share my experiences with you, so I could definitely make an effort to be more forthcoming.\n- As I also mentioned though, it’s not like there’s anything in particular, it’s just been generally bad.  Things are better now, though.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">(3)\n- Like the night before you mentioned that you wanted to take a break, I clearly didn’t pick up the queue and didn’t press you on whatever it was, I’m presuming it was more or less related to this, but I think that the lack of communication understanding goes both ways.  \n- You conceded as much, it’s not fair to expect me to press you on everything, and I don’t think it’s fair for you to be as upset as you are towards me for not sharing everything with you either.</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Q said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feel like most of the time when I’m not there, it feels like I don’t even like her</li>\n<li>sometimes I’m nice and cute, most of the time it’s just kinda like feels like we’re just friends kinda\nStartover</li>\n<li>I feel like I only treat her like I’m her gf sometimes and it hurts her feelings</li>\n<li>\n<p>I wrote in the letter why I’m upset.

This would have been my third summer. I worked on a variety of tasks, but most notable would be the team I was on last summer through to January which was the AI branch I suppose.

Ms. McCreary recommended that I apply despite the short lead time and I’m very thankful for the competitive opportunity.  I’m passionate about technology, I enjoy learning, and I hope that I can apply the skills that I’ve learned through my university coursework and prior internships to Credit Karma’s products and services. </p>\n<p>My technical skillsets primarily lie in back-end development and data modeling/analytics.  I enjoy programming in Python (who doesn’t!) but have educational and recreational experience in a variety of other programming languages including C, Java, HTML &#x26; CSS, JavaScript/React.  My non-technical stack includes planning, organization, and communication. I have professional experience working in teams and the agile development framework, and through my experience Coaching, organizing, and attending hackathons, I’ve developed solid leadership and follower-ship behaviors.  </p>\n<p>I’m a motivated student who can learn independently and thrive with mentorship.  During the initial screening call for this position, Ms. Michaela Green mentioned that the hiring process involves matching the interns with managers to ensure favorable teams which further excited me about this position.  I think that the most valuable use of my time this summer involves broadening my existing skills and developing new ones, and this position represents a fantastic opportunity to do just that. The prospect of a curated team of similarly impassioned interns and focused mentorship is invaluable at this stage of my career.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the consideration!\nPeter Murphy</p>\n<p>Karma Code\nHELPFULNESS - we go above and beyond to help others succeed</p>\n<p>EMPATHY - seek first to understand, then be understood</p>\n<p>PROGRESS - hustle, learn and improve </p>\n<p>OWNERSHIP - step up and own our decisions, actions and results\n- I think this is a great core value. It strikes me as empowering for employees. Like if ownership and responsibility are encouraged throughout the hierarchies of management it seems as though a level of trust comes along with that where your colleagues and superiors should have your back.\n- I think it ties in really well with the empathy aspect as well as the accountability\tof ownership is predicated on the understanding that folks aren’t going to immediately assume the worst</p>\n<p>Credit Karma Behavioral\nWhy I’m interested in Credit Karma:\nSo, I organize and help out at a ton of hackathons for my other job, and I’m not gonna lie, for awhile I’d been kind of turned off the fin tech space just because of the over saturation of projects like that I see at hackathons.  A lot of projects lack novelty or even the claimed functionality, and it’s kinda mentally exhausting to see folks present their health-related projects as a cure to cancer and similarly for the financial hacks a solution to poverty developed in like 36 hours. </p>\n<p>It seems like a lot of projects like that lack the background research into the domain necessary to develop an actually meaningful solution and I know that right now I don’t have that knowledge so I’ve never really taken a crack at a project like that, but I think that working with industry professionals in this financial space would definitely be super valuable in that sense.  Even though this would be a software engineering position, I think I’d gain a ton of knowledge about everything that goes on from logistical level in terms of delivering the services to the customers</p>\n<p>Using the app\nNot sure if it’s just because I’m a new user on the app, but after using some of the features like the tax return estimate, the app would automatically launch another feature that was a continuation of the previous feature.  I think this is a really good feature if it is the case that it only happens for new users in order to familiarize themself with the breadth of the services available through the app and they were easy to exit or cancel if I didn’t want to go through with the form or whatever, but it would definitely get tedious if the app kept trying to get me to fill out more forms after I’d finished the one use case I needed at that time</p>\n<p>I was poking around some of the other features as well such as the car loan calculator and despite not currently being interested in buying a car right now, I could see how this would actually be a tool I would use if I needed to take a loan to purchase a vehicle rather than having two independent setups like browsing the web and making these calculations on the app separately which is hard to pull off.  Typically, user interface wrappers like that just don’t hold up against the “intended” browser based experience, but the app remained clean, fast, responsive, and as content rich as I think I would desire if I were actually in the market.  For that feature in particular as well, I really like the explanation for why Carvana. When I saw the “Our recommendation heading” I cynically thought, “what’s in it for Credit Karma, there must be some kind of partnership here,” but then I scrolled down and my question was immediately answered by the subsequent “Why Carvana” section.  I thought that was pretty neat and kept scrolling down to see the feedback foot section of the page which made it easy for me to just click “yes or no” in response to whether that page was helpful without intruding or interrupting my use of the app or redirecting me to another page to fill out a survey or something.</p>\n<p>The only such intrusions that I experienced were security related and pretty necessary to proceed with those feature dialogues like “view compromised passwords”.</p>\n<p>The last thing I would mention that I enjoyed about using the app was the friendly UI.  A lot of the time when companies or developers try to swap out functional terms like “okay, select plan, view accounts” with more conversational phrases like “Let’s do this!” It comes across as corny and reminiscent of the Windows 10 crash message meme that’s like “Uh oh, something went wrong but don’t worry our code monkeys are working very hard to fix this”. However,I thought that the departure from bog standard language to positive language was tasteful and not too in your face.</p>\n<p>Annie Dang’s questions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>which of these projects interest me.

This is Peter Murphy, I just wanted to start a group chat to begin coordinating Jack’s Bachelor Party.\nDespite how funny <em>I</em> think it would be, Maggie has instructed me to disallow strippers (even of the male variety) from whatever it is we end up doing.  Additionally, in order to make sure we can accommodate Charlie as well, I imagine it’s probably best we choose something that’s not exclusive to 21+. </p>\n<p>I think the best middle ground is probably a sporting event sometime in the next few months and then perhaps a nice dinner afterwards? But I’m totally open to suggestions though, and I think the main constraint is when the most people are available. </p>\n<p>DC United Matches\nSat, April 2nd, 7:30 PM – Atlanta\nSat, April 16th, 7:30 PM – Austin\nSat, April 23th, 7:30 PM – NEngland\nSat, May 7th, 7:30 PM – Houston</p>\n<p>Music?\nSat, April 2, @ the anthem – Car Seat Headrest? </p>\n<p>Danny told Amos that he dreaded the thought of writing something under Amos’s name of which Amos might disapprove. “I said, ‘I don’t trust what I’m going to do,’” Danny said. “And he said, ‘You will just have to trust in the model of me that is in your mind.’”</p>\n<p>IQ regresses to the mean - Marcel from twitter</p>\n<p>Seth\nLeidos, contracting for Duke Energy, works in the CLT office, but most of his team is in NE\nElectrical Engineering </p>\n<p>Todo </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adam Smith, Emotional Sympathy fair-division</li>\n<li>Update passwords with a PW manager</li>\n<li>Mom’s FB PW: BluetickHound240</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tomorrow, wait for office to open (9:00 AM), print insurance proof (also counts as proof of residence), </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>License ID &#x26; Renewal. bring</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passport</li>\n<li>REAL Id</li>\n<li>Hopefully don’t need SNN Card (only necessary if lost or stolen)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Title &#x26; Registration</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For new NC residents, a valid out of state ID is sufficient along with </li>\n<li>Sole owner</li>\n<li>Proof of liability insurance: continuous liability insurance (provided by a licensed NC provider) on all vehicles titled and registered in NC </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hello?
