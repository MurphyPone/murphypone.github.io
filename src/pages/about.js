    <p>ðŸ‘‹Hi!</p>
    <p>
    My name is Peter, I'm a student at Virginia Tech studying Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the weekends, I'm a <a href="https://mlh.io/" target="_blank">Major League Hacking</a> Coach, which means that I <strike>travel to events to</strike> digitally assist hackathon organizers 
    in order to provide the best possible experience to their attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
    Formerly, I worked as a part time Software Engineer at <a href="https://greymatter.io/grey-matter" target="_blank">Decipher Technology Studios</a> where I 
    contributed to the productâ€™s backend control-plane features extending Envoyâ€™s service mesh API, as well as the Grey Matter Sense team's Log Anomaly Detector.
    </p>

    In my spare time, I enjoy helping organize <a href="https://vthacks.com/" target="_blank">my own hackathons</a>, working on side projects, researching reinforcment learning techniques, and solving Rubik's cubes!
