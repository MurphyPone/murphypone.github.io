Computers find better boundaries and arrangements depending on how the problem is formatted, be it in terms of geographical compactness or feature integrity, raw population equality, competitiveness, or some combination thereof. And, according to the criteria presented for examining the models, it can be concluded that models which prioritize the first two criteria of reviewability and transparency alone offer marked improvements over current institutional efforts. The latter two criteria of cost efficiency and correctness are almost a symptom of the computational nature of these methods.`,

    felt that gradually, as I wrote more and of-them, regular readers would start to see the 
    links between disparate ones, so that after a while, the coherence of the web would be quite clear. 
    My image of this was always geometric. I envisioned my intellectual "home territory" as a rather large
    region in some conceptual space, a region that most people do not see as a connected
    unit. Each new column was in a way a new "random dot" in that conceptual space,
    and as dots began peppering the space more fully over the months, the shape of my
    territory would begin to emerge more clearly. Eventually, I hoped, there would
    emerge a clear region associated with the name 'Metamagical Themas'" - Douglas Hofstadter`,
