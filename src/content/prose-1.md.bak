_In which: bad things happen to a man trapped in a cabin, who is visited by people who remind him of the bad things happening._

---

## Outside, there was a lake

The man stood gazing out at the slate lake.  Its murky ripples lapping against the jagged rocks which hinted at their ruinous nature.  His eyes were recessed into his skull, and they watered as the smoke from his cigarette rose towards them. He looked weary.  He flicked the cigarette towards the lake and turned away.  It fell at the base of the window standing between him and the outside and smoldered out of existence.

He was met with the familiar layout of the dimly lit room which hummed unless he listened for the humming.  But it was always there at the outskirts of his attention:  _whirring._  He took another drag the cigarette, the smoke from his last exhalation still standing behind him.  

<!-- what makes sense to be here -->

The chairs, the table, the drawer, the matches, the candle, the tobacco and papers, and the pen.  And of course the door, but it did not belong.  He was not surprised by any of the furniture.  They had always been there.  

A shadow reached through the window and touched the table leg. The man pulled one of the chairs aside and sat so as not to get in the way.  The shadows and noises could come in, but he could not leave.  He glanced at the doorway which was behind him, then turned back to the lake.  

There were no flowers or birds chirping at the windowsill, just the lake.  Not much of a beach to speak of, just gravel and then blackness which neither crept up nor retreated very far from its resting place just yonder.  _Yonder_.  Everything was yonder, out of reach.  The air whirred to remind him that it was not yonder.

## Outside, he hears footsteps

The man is squinting at a mirage on the lake.  He thinks he's seeing a ship, but he can't quite make it out.  He never sees any ships, so this peculiar.  He ought to turn to the door to address the shuffling noise, but he is captivated by the blob drifting across the horizon. It's not too often he sees anything new and exciting like the flickering of an amorphous blob outside of his focal length.  His head sinks forward in a feeble attempt to close the gap.   

The door opens and closes behind him and now he must turn around.  The elderly woman stands in front of the doorway.  She frowns and walks to the table. Clearing her throat and nodding conspicuously at the chair that had not been moved.  The man wonders why she doesn't just sit in the chair that's already been pulled away. It is perfect for sitting. He pulls the other chair away for her and takes the seat across. His seat, no longer out of the shadow.

"I thought you would call?" the woman croaks.

The shadow had moved from the table leg, and was now crossing his ankle.  

The man does not meet her gaze.  The woman is not imposing, but he should have called.  

He moves his leg.

The woman who frowns frowns some more.  The man takes a deep breath and reaches for his papers.  But he is too far away –chair pulled away and all– and the woman palms the tobacco and scoots herself from the chair to place the papers in the drawer.  The man's head sinks ever further forward, his neck protesting the childlike exaggeration.

The sun must arc across the cabin, but never low enough to pass through window.  It must push the shadows across the floor of the cabin, and the man with the shadows. 

The woman is back in her seat now, her hands clasped.  Sensing that she is getting ready to call to mind another of his faults, he now stands up to see if perhaps the sun is visible today.  The caster of shadows, haunting the dull carpet of the cabin.  The old woman coughs –not to get his attention, but out of necessity.  

Twisting his head, which at this point has been awkwardly protruding like a vulture's, the man glances up through the window.  The door closes again.  The gray clouds glance back, but keep shuffling across the sky.  The man watches the clouds like this for a while.  By the time he remembers that there is a ship demanding his attention, there is no longer a ship.  The lake is still once more, and the man's neck adds a jagged shadow the number already on the floor.

<!-- need more insanity here -->


## Outside, a youth hits himself in the head with a rock.

He knew what the sound was because the youth announced that he was going to hit himself in the head with the rock.  

He said "I'm going to hit myself in the head with this rock."  That's what he said.  The man heard him say it.  

It must not have been a big rock, or perhaps not a big youth, because he later heard him walk away.  His neck was sore.  The child didn't pass in front of the window.   

The had opened the drawer three times so far.  He struggled to remember.  On the fourth try, he found his papers.  But no leaves.  

<!-- more build up to opening the door -->

The doorway beckoned him.  He didn't like that, but it did, so he approached it.  

<!-- the doorway just leads him back in -->

## James is going to die soon.

---

## Outside, the cabin was on fire

Inside, it was cold and the man couldn't leave.

---

<!-- the doorway just leads him to sunlight -->

--- 

Something hit him in the back of the head knocking his glasses from his nose. He stumbled forward, the frames crunching beneath his feet. He put his glasses back on.
