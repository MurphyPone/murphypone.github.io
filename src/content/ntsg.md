## Preface
I initially wrote and formatted this study guide for RLCL 2424 entirely in HTML.  Yea, that's a lot of damage ‚Äì I don't think I'm going to go back and change in anytime soon, so pardon the weird hyperlink highlighting. The guide itself is semi-exhaustive üôè.

<p><b>Apocalypse</b> -  A literary genre in which an author, usually pseudonymous, describes symbolic and often bizarre visions that reveal the heavenly mysteries that make sense of earthly realities.</p>
<p><b>Apocalypticism</b> -  A world view held throughout the ancient world by many, Jews and Christians, that claimed that the present age is controlled by forces of evil, which would be destroyed at the end of time, when God would intervene in history to bring in his kingdom. This event was thought to be imminent.</p>
<p><b>Apocrypha</b> - A Greek term meaning, literally, "hidden things," used of books on the fringe of the Jewish or Christian canons of Scripture. The Jewish Apocrypha comprises books found in the Septuagint but not in the Hebrew Bible, including 1 and 2 Maccabees and 4 Ezra.</p>

(Jewish cleansing rituals were repeated as the need arose; John‚Äôs baptism, like the Christians‚Äô later, appears to have been a one-time occurrence.)

Happiness came in establishing a peaceful harmony with other like-minded people and enjoying the simple pleasures of daily existence.</p>
<p><b>Epistle</b> - Another designation for a private letter.  Some scholars have differentiated between ‚Äúepistles‚Äù as literary writings in the form of a letter, which were meant for general distribution, rather than for an individual recipient, and ‚Äúletters,‚Äù which were nonliterary form of personal correspondence.

<p><b>Farewell Discourse</b> - The final discourse that Jesus delivers in the Gospel of John (and not found in the Synoptics), chapters 13-16 (sometimes thought to include Jesus‚Äô prayer of chap. 17 as well); this discourse may have been created by combining two different accounts of Jesus‚Äô last words to his disciples before his arrest.</p>
<p><b>Firstfruits of the Resurrection</b> - A phrase used by the apostle Paul to refer to Jesus as the first one to be raised from the dead.  It is an agricultural image referring to the celebration held at the end of the first day of the harvest, in anticipation of going out to bring in the rest of the crops (the next day).  If Jesus is the ‚Äúfirstfruits,‚Äù then the rest of the resurrection (i.e., everyone else‚Äôs resurrection) will happen happen very soon.</p>

  <p style="padding-left: 25px">(1) Mark was the source for much of the narrative of Matthew and Luke;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 25px">(2) Q was the source for the sayings found in Matthew and Luke but not in Mark;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 25px">(3) M provided the material found only in Matthew‚Äôs Gospel;</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 25px">(4) L provided the material found only in Luke</p>

<p><b>Genius</b> - A man's guardian spirit (that of a woman was called Iuno).</p>
<p><b>Genre</b> - A kind of literature with specific literary features; in the modern world, for example, there are short stories, novels, and limerick poems (each with their own distinctive features); in the ancient world there were biographies, epic poems, general histories --and many other genres.  The major genres of the New Testament are Gospels (which are most like religious biographies), Acts (most like general histories), epistles, and apocalypses.</p>
<p><b>Gentile</b> -  A Jewish term for a non-Jew.</p>
<p><b>Gnosticism</b> - A group of ancient religions, closely related to Christianity, that maintained that sparks of a divine being had become entrapped in the present, evil world and could escape only by acquiring the appropriate secret gnosis (Greek for ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù) of who they were and how they could escape. This gnosis was generally thought to have been brought by an emissary descended from the divine realm.</p>
<p><b>Golden Rule</b> - Found in Matthew‚Äôs Sermon on the Mount, this is Jesus‚Äô saying that you should ‚Äúdo unto others as you would have them do unto you.‚Äù  A similar teaching can be found in a range of pagan and Jewish ethical teachers both before and after Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Gospel</b> - When uncapitalized, it refers not to a book but to the proclamation of the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù (from the Greek word euaggelion) of Christ‚Äôs salvation (e.g., the gospel of Paul is his message, not a book that he used).</p>
<p><b>Gospel</b> - When capitalized, it refers to a literary genre: a written account of the ‚Äúgood news: brought by Jesus Christ, including episodes involving his words and/or deeds (e.g., the Gospel of Luke or Peter).</p>

<h3><a name="chapter4">Chapter 4 - The Christian Gospels: A Literary and Historical Introduction to Oral Tradition</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Critical Dates: The canonical Gospels were all written in a 35-60 year range</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    </li>30 year gap between Jesus' death and the first written accounts of his life</li>
    <li>In that 30 year gap, various forms of <i>Christianity</i> spread like wildfire</li>
    <li>Jesus left behind 11 men and several women who spread word of his ministry, passion, and resurrection</li>
    <li>By 325 C.E., the whole Mediterranean and most of Asia Minor had a notable Christian population</li>
  </ul>
  <li>People believed that Jesus was going around saving people, strongly aiding conversion efforts</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>These stories about Jesus going around healing people after his death, being told by thousands were not historically true whatsoever</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Historical reliability and the phenomena of <b>Oral Tradition</b></li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Kernels of historical truth embedded in Oral Traditions have shifted over time to fit the <i>needs</i> of evolving situations</li>
    <li>2nd century proto-orthodox Christians attributed authorship of the Gospels of to early, important figures to lend their stories credibility</li>
    <li>However, none of the Gospels make authorial claims excluding perhaps Luke</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>The majority of the apostles were uneducated, Jewish fishermen and tax collectors, who were likely not-bilingual or literate in Greek</li>
      <li>They could have been sources for authors of the Gospels though, through Oral Tradition</li>
      <li>The author of Luke states that the accounts have been passed down from eye witnesses ‚Üí not very reliable necessarily</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Ancient writers were concerned with demonstrating <i>cosmic truth</i> rather than historical truth</li>
  <li>The gospels function as fables which provide a larger truth than what the actual text says</li>
  <li>Criteria for historical reliability:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Should not contradict itself,</li>
    <li>Should be generally plausible,</li>
    <li>Should be externally verified, preferably outside of its own [Gospel] genre</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All of the Gospels were written by Jews, and therefore the texts are heavily influenced by Jewish traditions, motifs, and most importantly the Jewish Law</li>
  <li><b>Passover</b> - The commemoration of the freeing of the 1st born sons of the Israelites via sacrificing of a lamb, sprinkling its blood on the doorpost, and eating a fast meal in preparation for the Exodus</li>
  <li>Judaism somewhat resembled a cultic devotion similar to other Greco-Roman polytheisms in that they would worship/sacrifice to a god (in adherence to the Abrahamic Law) to  improve their present life and satisfy the communal/household needs</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Believed in immortal beings in between them and God similar to Greco-Roman Daimonia : Cherubim, Seraphim, Angels/archangels</li>
    <li>Believed that God was known and knowable, but powerful and cultishly worshipped in Judea ‚Üí ‚ÄúJews‚Äù until military crisis saw the Jews driven out of Judea by Babylonians to Babylon, Egypt, etc., where they retained their religious practices until 600 B.C. ‚Üí <b>Diaspora</b> = dispersion</li>
    <li>Still worshipped the 1 God of Israel, not a local deity, and exclusively of Israel via Abrahamic Covenant</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Fewer Jews in Palestine around Jesus‚Äô life than after the Diaspora: ~7% Roman population</li>
  <li><b>Torah</b> = Guidance, direction ‚Üí Jewish Law, was viewed as God‚Äôs greatest gift to his people, not burdensome</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Ancient Jews were committed to the Law because they had already been showed favor as God‚Äôs chosen people ‚Üí the Law was their means of thanking God</li>

    <li>Destroyed ~7 years later as retribution for the Jewish rebellion</li>

<p>
  <ul>
  <li>"First" Gospel, widely treasured, shares 2/3rds of Mark</li>
  <li>Author was likely a Greek outside of Palestine writing in 80-85 C.E.</li>
  <li>Establishes Jesus as the<b>New Moses, the Last Prophet</b></li>
  <li>Stresses that Jesus is a man of Israel -- Matt‚Äôs Genealogy of 14</li>
  <li>Jesus is here to fulfill the Law‚Äôs intent ‚Üí still very much invested in Jewishness</li>
  <li>Fulfillment citations - 11 Total, ‚ÄúThis was done so that x was fulfilled‚Äù</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus very neatly fits into Jewish history</li>
      <li>Jesus' message is not new, just a continuation of Judaism ‚Üí the Final Prophet</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Matthew removes all of Mark‚Äôs Aramaic words and writes in Greek, but his audience is still Jews and Gentiles</li>
  <li><b>Jesus the New Moses</b> - Flees to Egypt to escape the slaughter of innocents ‚Üí receives/interprets the law on top of a mountain ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí directly parallels OT Exodus</li>
  <li><b>The Great Commission</b> and Matthew‚Äôs Gentile Mission</li>

      <li>‚ÄúGo and make disciples of all nations and peoples‚Äù at the end of the book which opens up the mission to gentiles</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Unlike in Mark, everyone but Jewish leaders (and the 3 pagan Magi) recognize Jesus as the Messiah ‚Üí perhaps to stress guilt?</li>

<h3><a name="chapter10">Chapter 10 - The Gospel of Luke: Exegesis of Good & Evil</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Believed to have been written by Luke‚Äôs traveling companion who also wrote Acts</li>
    <li>Written 80-85 C.E.</li>
    <li>Luke constructs Christianity directly in opposition to Satan/Demons</li>
    <li>Depicts Jesus as a prophet, like from the  Old Testament, to explain how Christianity spread from Jews to Gentiles too</li>
    <li>Four Verse preface is a standard Greek <b>Historiographic Prologue</b></li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Suggests that the topic was well researched and far superior to any previous sources, and the author identifies himself</li>
      <li>Makes an implicit, negative evaluation of Mark</li>
      <li>Says he is writing for ‚ÄúThe most excellent <b>Theophilus</b>‚Äù ‚Üí Lover of God, or perhaps a Roman governor in order to explain what Christianity is (not a threat to the state) ‚Üí informed defense = an <b>Apology</b></li>
      </ul>
    <li>As a two-set volume with Acts, Luke traces the miraculous birth of Christ and his ascent followed by the spread of the Church</li>
    <li>Birth narrative is similar, but different from Matthew</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem for Caesar Augustus‚Äôs census in Luke, they return home to Nazareth right away, not time for a flight to Egypt or the 3 magi</li>
        <li>In both Gospels, Jesus is born in Bethlehem, and raised in Nazareth, but for different reasons (Temple infancy narrative in Luke vs. Old Testament parallels in Matthew)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Jesus resembles a demigod figure, the pagan audience would understand his messiahship</li>
    <li>Luke has a <b>Dualistic Cosmology</b> : The Kingdom of God vs. the Material World</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Present theme in Mark and Matthew as well, but Luke stresses it more</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Jesus sends out 70-72 disciples to preach and ‚ÄúSatan fell from the heavens like a flash [gradually though] of Lightning‚Äù</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Jesus defeats Satan in the wilderness, comes back, and begins to exorcise demons who ask ‚ÄúHave you come to destroy us?‚Äù</li>
        <li>He expels demons with The Finger of God -- From Exodus and only used by Moses and Aaron ‚Üí Jesus is tantamount with Old testament Badasses</li>
        <li>Jesus doesn‚Äôt answer the demons, but Luke makes it clear that they‚Äôre afraid of him</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Everything bad in Luke is attributed to Satan ‚Üí very Greco-Roman</li>
    <li>Sick? blind ? ill? ‚Üí probably the work of  SATAN</li>
    <li>Luke repeats the practice of freeing people from bondage</li>
    <li>Very apocalyptic, but far less urgent than the other synoptics</li>
    <li>Luke‚Äôs <b>Two-Part Eschatology</b> - ‚ÄúEnd of the World‚Äù</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Kingdom of God is already here ‚Üí Jesus combating Satan‚Äôs materialism</li>
        <li>Kingdom of God will come fully later ... not tomorrow though, as Mark thought ‚Üí the Mission must be spread first</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Exegesis of Luke Chapter 11:14-23</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Satan is the Strong man and his property is the Material World</li>
          <li>Jesus is the Stronger man who strips satan of the fallacies and sin gave him dominion of the world</li>
          <li>Jesus is the stronger man, who frees people from bondage and ushers in the Kingdom of God</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Jesus‚Äô birth is announced to <b>Zechariah</b> in the Temple, Jesus is born and consecrated in the temple, recognized as the Messiah by Simeon and the old Jewish priestess Anna</li>
      <li>Jesus spends CH 9 - CH 19 traveling back to Jerusalem to be betrayed, much larger portion than the other gospels ‚Üí significant</li>
      <li>Luke also traces genealogy, but does so differently than Matthew, but both do so in order to show that Jesus is the Son of God</li>
      <li>Luke‚Äôs gospel begins and ends in the Temple</li>
      <li>Explicitly claims to be an anointed prophet of God at the start of his public ministry</li>
      <li>Jesus‚Äô death is totally in control: ‚ÄúFather into your hands I commend my spirit‚Äù</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Less atonement like Mark and John where Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God</li>
          <li>‚ÄúDaughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me‚Äù ‚Üí concerned for others, but confident in himself</li>
          <li>Asks for forgiveness for those who are killing him</li>
          <li>‚ÄúToday you will be with me in paradise‚Äù</li>
          <li>Luke stresses that Jesus was innocent ‚Üí Centurion Longinus recognizes ‚ÄúTruly this man was innocent‚Äù ‚Üí Archetype of a Martyr setting the stage for Acts</li>
          <li>Jesus bloody sweat was later added to corroborate Mark‚Äôs depiction of Jesus‚Äô agitation</li>
        </ul>
      <li>For Luke, salvation is not brought about through Jesus‚Äô death, but through the subsequent repentance for the miscarriage  of justice</li>
      <li>Author of Luke, Paul‚Äôs traveling companion wrote Acts too</li>
      <li>Describes the Temple heavily, God‚Äôs message comes through it, but the Jews reject it ‚Üí reject Jesus</li>

<p>
  <ul>
  <li>‚ÄúAll things came into being through him‚Äù -- prologue</li>
  <li>Acc. to Plato there‚Äôs a distinction between ‚Äúbeing‚Äù and ‚Äúcoming into being‚Äù</li>
  <li>Coming into being implies a beginning/time when it didn‚Äôt exist</li>
  <li>Jesus does not come into being, he always was, with God ‚Üí pre-existent</li>
  <li>Jesus is very otherworldly and divine in John ‚Üí ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù</li>
  <li>John‚Äôs Defining Features</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Poetic literary style, philosophical, ‚Äúhigh‚Äù literary style, excellent flowing Greek</li>
      <li>Miracles are more spectacular than in the synoptics ‚Üí seven Signs</li>
      <li>Less action and more discourse e.g. CH 13-19 is a single speech</li>
      <li>Indirect authorial claim?  Introduces a possible perspective shift from the Synoptics ‚Üí ‚ÄúBeloved Disciple caused these things to be written‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The Beloved Disciple - A member of Jesus‚Äô inner circle, never explicitly name ‚Üí believed to be John, Son of Zebedee</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus entrusts his mother to him, and he outruns Peter to Jesus‚Äô tomb</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Nitty Gritty Chop-Suey</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li><b>Aporias</b> - literary seams, interruptions, shifts in the text which indicate a change in author/source</li>
      <li>CH 20: reads like an ending to the Gospel/source</li>
      <li>CH 21: geographical, temporal and contextual shifts ‚Üí picks up with a song of Zebedee and keeps going</li>
      <li>Changes in Jesus‚Äô style of teaching, the chronological framework, the characteristics of his miracles, and his opponents</li>
    </ul>
  <li>In CH 2: Jesus flips the tables in the temple, and from then on ‚Äúthe Jews‚Äù in general, not just the leadership, are plotting to kill him for the rest of the Gospel</li>
  <li>Very open about his identity, unlike Mark</li>
  <li>His 3 year ministry ends in CH 12, then he retreats to a more private ministry w/lengthy speeches ‚Üí timeline slows significantly after his ‚Äúretirement‚Äù in direct contrast to the flow of Mark which instead accelerates</li>
  <li>In the synoptics, Jesus teaches by parable, in John, he teaches by lengthy philosophical, abstract speeches</li>
  <li>His eschatology is much more ambiguous than the synoptics which had more immediate apocalypses</li>
  <li>Salvation rooted in believing in Jesus as the Son of God and communion with God, but not necessarily the Kingdom of God</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>A physical change must occur too: ‚ÄúYou will become like the wind‚Äù</li>
      <li>Jesus says you must be born ‚Äúanothen‚Äù ‚Üí both : from above/higher, and anew/again ‚Üí very clever Greek</li>
      <li>Jesus is the only one who explicitly espouses eternal life</li>
      <li>Do not conflate eternal life with the Kingdom of God which was thought of as a legitimate divine, but physical territory (to be delivered by the Messiah)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Jesus waits 3-4 days to resurrect Lazarus to show that he can recombine body with soul which was unheard of in Greco-Roman literature outside of necromancy which was heavily frowned upon and was only a temporary ‚Äútrick‚Äù</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Different from the synoptics where Jesus is not a trick-pony</li>
      <li>Jesus is more than willing to perform public signs <i>in order</i> convince people of his divine origin</li>
    </ul>
  <li>No transfiguration, Jesus is already  the radiant post-Transfiguration character for the whole Gospel</li>
  <li>No baptism, because why baptize <i>God</i></li>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô opponents are all of Judaism, who were antagonizing the Johannine Community at the time of the Gospel of John‚Äôs publication</li>
  <li>Only 9 instances of 2-3 word verbatim phrases ‚Üí  likely only shared Oral Tradition as a source, which is why it still shares Jesus‚Äô biographical skeleton</li>
  <li>John‚Äôs Sources - Authored the Gospel, and maybe 1, 2, 3 John, and Revelation to varying degrees of certainty</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">

<h3><a name="chapter12">Chapter 12 - From John‚Äôs Jesus to the Gnostic Christ</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Gnosticism was highly derivative of <b>Platonism</b></li>
  <li>Preferred the Gospel of John, but there was not much gnosticism in the New Testament</li>
  <li>Along with <b>Marcionism</b>, gnosticism was very popular and widely hated by proto-orthodox Church Leaders</li>
  <li>Before the Nag Hammadi was discovered, we only knew what Church Leaders wrote about Gnosticism in condemnation</li>
  <li>Gnosticism as a philosophy ‚Üí <b>Redeemer Myth</b> - In the beginning was God, and all our souls were unified in him. Some accident caused the Gnostis fall from <b>Pleroma</b>, loss of memory, into oblivion.  So now we are suck in materiality.  From Pleroma, a redeemer, Christ, is sent who reveals the truth of our origin, allowing our spiritual ascent back to pleroma to abide in communion with God</li>
  <li>Characteristics of Gnosticism</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Metaphysical dualism ‚Üí the spirit and matter are at odds with each other</li>
      <li>Physical world was created by an inferior God of the Old Testament, which is why the material world is inferior</li>
      <li>Brought about by cosmic disaster - the fall, evil God created all that is bad</li>
      <li>God is unknowable ‚Üí a pure spirit who is so great that we don‚Äôt/can't even know</li>
      <li><b>Aeons</b> - Personifications of God‚Äôs capacities</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Also inhabit the divine realm with God as divine beings</li>
          <li>Reason, Will, grace -- personifications of virtue</li>
          <li>Last one, called <b>Sophia</b>, wisdom, who wanted to know the divine realm</li>
          <li>She falls, as she is falling, creating other Aeons outside of the divine realm</li>
          <li>Creates <b>Ialdabaoth</b>, creator of matter which is evil</li>
          <li>Ialdabaoth divides Sophia throughout human bodies</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Divine Spark - like the matrix, if you realize you‚Äôre trapped, you can be freed</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">

<h3><a name="chapter14">Chapter 14: Historical Jesus and an Introduction to Apocalypticism</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The most reliable sources are the Gospels which are conflicting texts, written decades after Jesus‚Äô life, in a different language, based on Oral Tradition which had been circulating for some time‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>Historians establish criteria so that sources can be evaluated for historical accuracy</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Numerous accounts that can cross-referenced</li>
      <li>Originated close to Jesus lifetime to mitigate exaggeration</li>
      <li>Produced independently of one another ‚Üí no collusion</li>
      <li>Do not contradict each other</li>
      <li>Internally consistent</li>
      <li>Not biased so the subject supports author‚Äôs interests</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Pagan / Jewish texts before 130 C.E. that mention Jesus</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Very few, as if Jesus had 0 immediate impact</li>
      <li>0 mention in pagan texts in that 100 year span</li>
      <li><b>Pliny the Younger</b> - 112 C.E. Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus is the first to reference Jesus</li>
      <li><b>Suetonius</b> - Roman historian who wrote about Jewish riots around 41-54 C.E. which were instigated by one ‚ÄúChrestu‚Äù ‚Üí Christ</li>
      <li><b>Tacitus</b> - Roman historian, mentioned Christianity in his history of Rome, titled <i>The Annals</i></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Mentions how Nero user Christianity as the scapegoats for his burning of Rome ‚Üí references Jesus‚Äô death @ Pontius Pilate and the superstition that later emerged</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>Very few Jewish Texts from this period at all</li>
  <li><b>Mishnah</b> - Rabbinic opinions on Jewish Law published two centuries after Jesus died</li>
  <li><b>Josephus</b> - Provided insight on the Jewish war against Rome 66-73 C.E.</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Authored a 20 volume history on Judaism from the Fall in the Garden through to 66 C.E.</li>
      <li>Identifies Jewish high priest Ananus 62 C.E. who kills James ‚ÄúThe brother of Jesus who called himself the Messiah‚Äù</li>
      <li>Identifies Jesus as the Messiah in volume 18 ‚Üí potentially modified later on by a Christian scribe</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Christian Sources</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Non-canonical Gospels published through the 8th Century</li>
      <li>Little information outside of the New Testament can be considered Historical ‚Üí most historical would be Paul who talks more about the cosmic truths than history</li>
      <li>Constrains sources to the Gospels, written 40-65 years after Christ's death, most of which source Oral Tradition...</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Ranking Sources in terms of historical value: Paul, Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, Josephus</li>
  <li>Must account for bias e.g. the <i>Gospel of Peter</i> blames Jewish Herod for Jesus‚Äô death, slightly anti-semitic</li>
  <li><b>Criterion for Independent Attestation</b> - Negates the historicity of stories shared by the synoptics because mark could have lied, and both Matthew & Luke copied Mark</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Exceptions include Baptism stories which appear in Mark | Q  | John which are all independent of each other</li>
      <li>Jesus' Brother James appears Mark | John | Paul</li>
      <li>Seeds as a metaphor for the Kingdom of God  Mark | Q | Thomas</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Similarity</b> - If the history perfectly aligns with the theological motivations of the author, that‚Äôs kind of suspicious</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Passing an agenda via Jesus‚Äô mouth (e.g. the gentile mission)</li>
      <li>Matthew very Jewish, Luke very gentile</li>
      <li>Problem with this criteria is that it‚Äôs very likely that they overlap: presuppositions of the author AND what actually happened can both be true‚Ä¶</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Dissimilarity</b> - More likely reliable if it can be shown to be different from the agendas of Judaism and Christianity</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Best used to show what he did, not what he didn‚Äôt do</li>
      <li>Things that are not Jewish, because Jesus was reforming Judaism</li>
      <li>Things that are not Christian, because Christianity came after Jesus</li>
      <li>E.g. Jesus baptized by John, which implies his spiritual inferiority, why include that unless it actually happened?</li>
      <li>E.g. Betrayed by one of the 12</li>
      <li>E.g. Jesus hanging out with tax collectors and sinners</li>
      <li>Problem is that the things that are embarrassing/theologically challenging vary by culture</li>
      <li>E.g. ‚ÄúLet the dead bury the dead‚Äù --Q 9:60</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>It doesn't make sense for Jesus to say that, the burial process was very important, and it‚Äôs not a thing that Christianity lost from Judaism either</li>
          <li>Very Apocalyptic: You don‚Äôt have time to bury people, come follow me <i>NOW</i></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Problem is that Jesus was Jewish which is very similar to Px, so there‚Äôs probably a lot of things he said about which both agree</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Contextual Credibility</b> - Things that just don't make sense</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>E.g. the Gospel of Philip referencing Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist which were non-existent yet.</li>
      <li>Strictly negative application ‚Üí used to identify things which did not happen</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Multiple Attestation</b> - More likely to be reliable if it is preserved in two or more sources that are independent of each other</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Most objective criterion ‚Üí does not require interpretation</li>
      <li>E.g. Parable of mustard seed appears in the Synoptics and the <i>Gospel of Thomas</i></li>
      <li>Jesus‚Äô sayings of marriage appear in Mark and in Corinthians</li>
      <li>Problem: lies could be injected into the Oral Tradition early on and there could be reliable things Jesus said or did that some authors didn‚Äôt like so they didn‚Äôt include</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Criterion of Contextual Credibility</b> - Things that make sense in the context of what we already know to be true</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>E.g. Jesus‚Äô discussion with the tax collector in Matthew 18</li>
      <li>Problem: Presuppositions about historical Jesus could lead to false conclusion and texts are always up for interpretation</li>
      <li>Also depends on which criteria is used to establish ‚Äúwhat we know‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  <li>What we do know about historical Jesus:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Galilean, born ~4 B.C.E</li>

      <li>Spent passover week in Jerusalem where he did something (likely in the Temple) which got him in trouble</li>
      <li>Arrested, crucified -- which is an exclusively Roman execution</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Pontius Pilate is depicted as a tool ‚Üí passes blame to the Jews, but historically, he got in trouble for his excessive crucifixions‚Ä¶</li>
          <li>Rome gets antsy during Passover because it‚Äôs a Jewish celebration of their mantra that ‚ÄúGod always liberates God‚Äôs people.‚Äù</li>
          <li>Jesus comes in talkin bout liberation ‚Üí looks like a terrorist, so they kill him</li>
          <li>Jesus pisses off the Sadducees in the temple who go to Daddy‚Äôs $ ‚Üí Romans</li>
          <li>The claim to be God would only have pissed off Jews, Roman was highly polytheistic ‚Üí blasphemy wasn‚Äôt a crime to them -- it was because of the political dissidence he was stirring up</li>
        </ul>
      <li>This continues a trend of persecution spiking in 64 A.D. under Nero, as well as 250 A.D. when Germanic tribes were at the borders and internal Roman operations were crumbling</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">

<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô preached an immediate apocalyptic perspective and message</li>
  <li>Both Mark and Q portray Jesus as an Apocalypticist</li>
  <li>Historically, we know that Jesus predicted the destruction of the Temple which is multiply attested in Mark and John</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>He calls the Temple a cult : ‚ÄúDen of Thieves‚Äù ‚Üí similar to the <b>Essenes</b> who believed that worship of God had gotten out of hand and became ascetics</li>
      <li>Sadducees abused their power ‚Üí Daddy‚Äôs $</li>
    </ul>
  <li>No need for the Temple when the Kingdom of God arrives ‚Üí Jews would not have thought that this idea was very cash money</li>
  <li>12 Disciples ‚Üí very apocalyptic number, fulfillment of the 12 Tribes of Israel</li>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô association with tax collectors and sinners ‚Üí Jewish leaders reject his mission, so he turns to those most in need of repentance in light of the imminent judgement</li>
  <li>Associated with women in all four gospels which reinforces the apocalyptic message ‚Äúlast shall be first and first shall be last‚Äù</li>
  <li>His exorcisms are multiply attested and not uncommon for a rabbi</li>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô healings and removals of sickness are the manifestations of the Kingdom of God which is without imperfection</li>
  <li>All the these things portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet who foresaw the destruction of Israel/the Temple as a prefix to the entrance of the Kingdom of God</li>
  <li>In response to the <i>Da Vinci Code‚Äôs</i> claims of his affairs with Mary Magdalene</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Apocalyptic Jews (Essenes/Paul) were largely bachelors</li>
      <li>Every. Single. Gospel. Canon or not lacks any mention of Jesus‚Äô spouse/ child implicated by the book</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Jesus erases marriage in the Kingdom of God</li>
  <li>Sermon on the Mount stresses the reversal of status quo ‚Üí get on board, relinquish your power in order to enter the Kingdom of God</li>
  <li><i>Confession is a manifestation of the Pharisees‚Äô push for a status quo</i></li>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô apparent rejection of family values:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Hate your mother, father, brothers, and sisters and turn to me</li>
      <li>His own mother and father rejected his public ministry after all</li>

<h3><a name="chapter18">Chapter 18 -
 From Jesus to the Gospels</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô resurrection was his initial claim to fame, his message was only put on blast afterwards, via the gospels</li>
  <li>Christianity fundamentally was a belief in his death for sin, and his resurrection</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Different from the religion he espoused ‚Üí Religion of Jesus vs. the Religion <i>about</i> Jesus</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Historically, Christianity begins with Jesus‚Äôs death and resurrection which sparked belief in his message</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>In some sense then, Christianity was founded by women</li>
      <li>All the Gospels agree that <i>some</i> group of women encountered the empty tomb</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>However, Paul, the first Christian author, does not mention the empty tomb</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Alternatively, the women are giddy and terrified -- unreliable, which is why their reports of the resurrection were not believed, explaining why Paul doesn‚Äôt mention them</li>
    </ul>
  <li>First followers of Jesus, Apocalyptic Jews, wouldn‚Äôt have thought his death was for sin, but that God had raised him to ascend</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Similarly, people who were believed to have been ‚Äúexalted into heaven‚Äù were divinized - made into Gods : Enoch, Moses, Julius Caesar</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô resurrection influenced interpretation of his message ‚Üí he claimed to be the Son of God, and referred to God as Father ‚Üí strengthened his message</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Messiah ‚Üí ruler of the Kingdom of God, which arrived with the Son of Man ‚Üí obey his teachings about how to implement the Kingdom of God</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Before Jesus, no Jews believed that the Messiah would die for sins</li>
  <li>Jews understood scripture to be a personal revelation of wisdom for coping with life</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Psalms of Lament which speak about a: ‚Äúrighteous man who comes to suffer at the hands of God‚Äôs enemies and be vindicated‚Äù</li>
      <li>Not viewed as Messianic until Jesus‚Äô death and Px spread</li>
      <li>Christians believed Jewish suffering in Psalms foreshadowed Jesus' passion ‚Üí it was God‚Äôs plan the whole time</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Isaiah</b> - Wrote about the suffering of God‚Äôs righteous one</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>"Songs of the suffering servant"</li>
      <li>Died for the sins of people ‚Üí atonement</li>
      <li>Interpreted to refer to Israel under Babylon, not Messianic until Christianity</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Whereas crucifixion was viewed as a Jewish stumbling block (how could the Messiah be killed so shamefully?), it became the cornerstone of Christianity</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Not a miscarriage of justice ‚Üí part of God‚Äôs plan</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>‚ÄúSon of Man‚Äù</b> - from Daniel</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jews envisioned a cosmic ruler/Messiah</li>
      <li>Pagans imagined just a human</li>
    </ul>
  <li>‚ÄúSon of God‚Äù - even more Messianic/kingly ‚Üí anointed, not the image of a religious leader‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>Once different canons were established, the differences in Gospels became homogenized rather highlighted</li>
  <li><b>Vicarious Suffering</b> - Originated with Jewish martyrs to describe dying to save others</li>
  <li><b>Maccabean Revolt</b> - Eleazar single handedly attacks an elephant who he thought was carrying the King of Syria ‚Üí (((enemy of God)))</li>

  <li>Paul was the strongest advocate for the gentile mission at a time when it would have made no sense people who were not ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs people‚Äù could be saved</li>

II. <b>Thanksgiving</b>
  <ul>
    <li>‚ÄúI give thanks to God for you and your faithful steadfast in the face of persecution‚Äù or whatever, in order to preface the theme of the letter</li>

III.  <b>Body</b> - The text based on the occasion of the letter
  <ul>
    <li>His response to big problems in the churches he previously founded</li>
    <li>Sleeping with your step mother, speaking in tongues, the rich eating all of the supper, Christians suing other Christians, people eating idol meat, etc.</li>

<h3><a name="chapter23">Chapter 23 -  Romans: The Gospel According to Paul</a></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Longest and most sophisticated letter of the Pauline Corpus</li>
  <li>Closest thing to a summary of Pauline theology that we have ‚Üí shaped Christian theology for centuries to come</li>
  <li>Writing to a church he did not establish, therefore it is unburdened by a solution to their problems, since Paul didn‚Äôt know them</li>
  <li>However, as his audience did not know him, his credibility/education is very important to give his letter authority</li>
  <li>Not writing to address a specific problem, instead preaching his interpretation of the Gospel</li>
  <li>Perhaps writing to them to ask for support for his Western Church ‚Üí the Roman church was huge and important</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Writes to address their shaky perception of him (he who abolished Jewish Law?)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Follows the ancient rhetorical style of diatribe ‚Üí as a student of Platonic dialectic</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Advances a thesis and then disproves legitimate counterpoints</li>
      <li>Shows that the author has authority and is always right</li>
      <li>Romans would have appreciated the rhetorical style</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Writes to persuade his opposition within the Church of Rome about the truth of the Gospel message: Jews and Gentiles are equal in the eyes of God and equally saved by Christ‚Äôs resurrection</li>
  <li>‚ÄúThe one who is righteous will live by faith‚Äù</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Part of his opening statement, likely comes from an early Christian creed as it is distinct from his usual style, but would be familiar to his audience</li>
    </ul>
  <li>First - Paul is not ashamed of the Gospel ‚Üí he is very confident in it (from God)</li>
  <li>Second - Paul's Gospel is God‚Äôs powerful means of salvation ‚Üí apart from Paul‚Äôs Gospel, there would be no salvation</li>
  <li>Third - Salvation comes to those who have faith ‚Üí Paul demands <b>justification</b> (to be made right before God)</li>
  <li>Fourth - Salvation comes first to the Jews, then the Gentiles ‚Üí Jews are the chosen people of God and his Law, but they are equal to Gentiles in terms of Judgement</li>
  <li>Fifth - The Gospel reveals the righteousness of God ‚Üí God has not forsaken his covenant with the Jews, but Jesus fulfilled that covenant through his passion, so that all might be saved</li>
  <li>Sixth - Scripture proclaims the Gospel ‚Üí cites Jewish scripture to the Romans who respected the ancient religion</li>
  <li>No formal Gospel exists yet, so Paul is referring to his own message which was revealed by God</li>
  <li>Paul‚Äôs models for salvation</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li><b>Judicial</b> - Mankind is on trial for its sins before God</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>The penalty is death, because god is Just ‚Üí the human condition is death for its sins</li>
          <li>God is merciful (by grace) and Jesus is without sin, his death pays for everyone else's</li>
          <li>Grace is undeserved, unearned ‚Üí through belief in the Death and Resurrection</li>

      <li><b>Gospel message rooted in Sacred Scripture</b> - Abraham was justified through works, obedience, and by trusting his faith ‚Üí Christianity inherited this covenant</li>
      <li><b>The Death and Resurrection bring freedom</b> - Flesh is subject to sin which died in Christ</li>

  <b>Summary</b>

  I.  Praescriptio - Opens with a warm Greeting to the pre-established church which foreshadows the main points to follow

        <li>that the Romans share it</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  III.  Body - Expression of Pauline Theology
  <ul>
    <li>Sinfulness of Gentiles - worshipping of created rather than creator</li>
    <li>Distinguishes Christians from Jews - yet there is no difference in Jew and Gentile in the eyes of God because of Jesus‚Äô crucifixion</li>
    <li>God is knowable from the Natural Order by creation alone - creation is orderly</li>
    <li>Humans beings get fixated on the world itself, rather than seeing it as a reflection of God‚Äôs benevolence ‚Üí inability to see past this world</li>
    <li>This leads to other sins: sexual immorality, idolatry, etc.</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Idolatry gives rise to every other sin: worshipping the world, not its creator</li>
        <li>This argument sounds very Jewish ‚Üí who the Romans viewed as very traditional</li>
        <li><b>Paraprosdokian</b> - Pulls the rug out from under them ‚Äúit was Christianity the whooole tiiime‚Äù</li>
      </ul>
    <li>People judging others - those who judge others are ‚Äústoring up God‚Äôs wrath‚Äù</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Not concerned with individual hypocrisy as much as the group political claims ‚Üí Jews are inferior, etc.</li>
        <li>God judges people by their deeds, not by their group identity, and he is impartial ‚Üí Paul condemns judgement as badly as idolatry</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Jewish judgement of the Gentiles - the chosen people have a high moral standard, but they don‚Äôt follow all the laws the espouse, giving them a bad name among gentiles ‚Üí making God look bad</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Your actions can undercut your salvation</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Sin is a universal reality ‚Üí no one is free from it because God is a just God</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>God serves death for sin ‚Üí everyone dies</li>
        <li>If sin is the problem, God‚Äôs response is gracious justification opportunity through Jesus</li>
        <li>The Old Testament God is Just; and it's the same God in the New Testamnet, but he sent Jesus who was crucified for our sins allowing for mercy</li>
        <li>Humans are required to have faith in what God has done through Christ</li>
        <li>We can be redeemed (‚Äúpurchased‚Äù, slavery connotation) from our oppressive sins. Bought back in Christ via faith</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Various models of salvation from Paul</li>
    <li>God‚Äôs actions via Jesus are full of grace in that we do not even deserve the opportunity for salvation</li>
    <li>Paul crafts a dualistic image of God</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>God is Just and we will die</li>
        <li>God is loving and merciful via Jesus whose death redeems our sins ‚Üí faith is the only appropriate response</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="chapter24">Chapter 24 - Paul in Relation to Jesus, James, Thecla, & Theudas<a/></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Did Paul and Jesus represent the same religion?</li>
  <li>Members of Pauline churches certainly told stories about Jesus which could have eventually become the Oral Tradition of the Gospel</li>
  <li>Paul rarely says anything about historical Jesus other than:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Born of a woman as a Jew, had brothers, one of whom was named James</li>
      <li>Conducted his ministry among Jews</li>
      <li>Had a last supper on the night he was betrayed</li>
      <li>Knows what Jesus said at the Last Supper</li>
      <li>Knows that Christians should not get divorced and should pay their preachers</li>
      <li>Paul parallels some of Jesus‚Äô teachings: pay taxes, obey the law, and love their neighbors ‚Üí but he does not attribute these teaching to Jesus</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Things he doesn‚Äôt include:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Parents, early life, baptism, wilderness</li>
      <li>Kingdom of God, no parables, healings, transfigurations, cleansing of the Temple</li>
      <li>No interrogation by the Sanhedrin or Pontius Pilate</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Option 1 ‚Üí no occasion to mention these things</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>He clearly knew the apostles would have been telling these stories</li>
      <li>Never mentions stories to converts because he opened with them in his mission ‚Üí they would have already known them</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>However, most of his letters are reminders of what he already taught them...</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Paul had ample opportunity to use stories to support him, but he rarely did...</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Option 2 - Considered Jesus stories irrelevant to his mission</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus' death and resurrection are of most import</li>
      <li>But he still cites Jesus often...</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Option 3 - He just didn‚Äôt know enough about Jesus</li>
  <li>Nonetheless, he and Jesus agree on a lot: monotheism, covenants with Israel, Apocalypticism</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Jesus still maintains Jewish Law, but Paul says no amount of obedience is greater than faith</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Paul thinks faith alone vs. James faith and works model</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Probably had different definitions of ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and ‚Äúworks‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Thecla</b> - Takes Paul‚Äôs celibate advice to heart and ends her engagement to follow the Apostles</li>
  <li><b>Theudas</b> - Teacher of the infamous 2nd century gnostic <b>Valentinus</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Said to have been a disciple of Paul</li>
    </ul>
  <li>There were several sects of Pauline Christianity</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Pseudepigrapha</b> - A work authored under a false name/somebody else‚Äôs name</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>A field of study for advanced students: forgery/imitation</li>
      <li>Sometimes documents were signed under their teacher‚Äôs name in an act of humility/attribution of the containing knowledge to that person</li>
      <li>Writing that makes an authorial claim, unlike the Gospels</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Homonymous</b> - A writing attributed to someone of the same name</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>John of <i>Revevelation</i> and John of Zebedee</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Deutero-Pauline Epistles</b> - Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians</li>
  <li><b>Pastorals</b> - 1, 2 Timothy, Titus</li>
  <li><b>2 Thessalonians</b> - most contested Pauline Epistle</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Claims to be written by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy</li>
      <li>Likely written in the late 1st century, after Paul‚Äôs death</li>
      <li>Written to Christians who were suffering for their faith</li>
      <li>1, 2 Thessalonians are verbatim in several places, but have very split eschatologies</li>
      <li>Repeated insistence that Paul is the author, and that people should not believe in other texts written under his name</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Typical tactic of Pseudepigrapha: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe others, but I am true‚Äù</li>
          <li>Author discounts ‚Äúwhatever an earlier letter from ‚ÄòPaul‚Äô may have said, do not be deceived‚Äù -- Quoth the deceiver</li>

      <li>Theological differences</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Delayed arrival of the Kingdom of God: ‚ÄúDo dead people go to heaven?‚Äù</li>
          <li>Uncontested 1 Thessalonians says yes, and they go first</li>
          <li>2 Thessalonians says: worldwide signs will indicate the end of days and the coming of the KoG: rebellion, lawless one revealed</li>
        </ul>
        <li>2 Thessalonians says Jesus will return to defeat the antichrist</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Pretty huge chunk of theology here, why wouldn‚Äôt Paul mention it elsewhere?</li>
            <li>The rest of Paul‚Äôs undisputed corpus says ‚Äúthe end is coming ASAP like a thief in the night‚Äù ‚Üê 1 Thessalonians </li>
            <li>Counter-argument: someone claiming to be Paul wrote to the Thessalonians saying that Jesus returned and the Kingdom of God is upon them, so they stop working because the full realization of the Kingdom of God is like 1 day away.</li>
            <li>Explains 2 Thessalonians authorial claim and the disparate ‚Äòend of days‚Äô theology, it‚Äôs like a clarification for them to get back to work</li>
      <li>Written to address those who thought that the day of judgement had already arrived</li>
      <li>Describes how they will know the apocalypse is here/coming</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Anti-Christ -- unique to 2 Thessalonians</li>
          <li>People believed it was so imminent/present that they quit their jobs and became a social burden on the rest of the Christian community</li>
          <li>1 Thessalonians says ‚Äúit will come like a thief in the night‚Äù, 2 Thess says there will be several advanced warnings</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Antichrist</b> - A central focus of 2 Thessalonians which is not mentioned anywhere else but is a pretty big portion of this author‚Äôs theology</li>
      <li>So, who wrote 2 Thessalonians? Someone being persecuted as a Christian in the 1st century, either by a Jew or Roman</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Probably post 70 C.E., and they must have had access to 1 Thess. Bc of the verbatim agreements</li>

    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Written by ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù in prison, addressing the false teachers in Colossae</li>

      <li>Condemns the false ‚Äúphilosophy and empty deceit‚Äù ‚Üí but does not specify what these teachings are, assumes his audience knows</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">

        </ul>
      <li>Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, therefore maintain your good Christian faith until he returns</li>
      <li>Writing style differs greatly from the undisputed Pauline Corpus</li>
      <li>Author says that Christians have died and risen in Christ, but Paul says that we have died, and are still awaiting resurrection in Christ</li>
      <li>Beginning of the instantiation of ‚Äúhousehold rules‚Äù that are not present in earlier Christian writing because the apocalypse was imminent, so it didn‚Äôt matter</li>
      <li>Insistent claim of authorship</li>
      <li>Hard to distill whether or not it‚Äôs undisputed because Paul never published a comprehensive theology as he usually wrote to address specific issues</li>

        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>But not a physical, literal resurrection</li>
          <li>Undisputed Paul disagrees AND believes in a physical resurrection ‚Üí but it will happen in the future, not already, as the author of Colossians says</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Contains lengthy exhortations which imply a larger, more established church than the ones that existed/were addressed in the undisputed corpus</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Needs more rules, since we‚Äôve been resurrected, and we‚Äôre now a bigger church</li>

      <li>Discusses <b>Judaizers</b> similar to those in Galatians</li>
      <li>Says that the requirements of the Law have been erased by the crucifixion, unlike Galatians which says it was only superseded</li>
      <li>Opponents in Colossae taught ‚Äúworship of angels‚Äù and perhaps advocated a more mystical Judaism or even Jewish gnosticism</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Author says Jesus created other invisible beings (angels) for Jesus, and that Jesus is superior and only Jesus can grant salvation</li>
          <li>‚ÄúPaul‚Äù is writing to curb this degree of Jewish mysticism</li>
          <li>Similar to Neo-Platonism which said that you can contact God through vertically networking the cosmos by intermediary lesser beings</li>

  <li><b>Catholic Epistles</b> - 1, 2, 3 John, Timothy, Titus, etc. general epistles not written by Paul</li>
  <li><b>Self-definition</b> - How early Christians came to distinguish themselves from Jews ‚Üí groups defined in opposition to one another</li>
  <li><b>Adoptionists</b> - Such as the Ebionites, believed Jesus was man, then was adopted by God</li>
  <li>Christianity continued to be driven inward, requiring conversion for admission via special rites such as baptism and Lord‚Äôs Supper</li>
  <li>To the Romans, Christians look like people who aren‚Äôt members of the pagan cult which prays for the welfare of the state, they don‚Äôt practice Judaism, but they worship the same Jewish God‚Ä¶ looks like Px are exploiting a loophole</li>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> portrays Jewish Law as impartial and imperfect, highlighting its inadequacy as an Old Covenant</li>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> does not follow the form of an epistle, unknown author and audience, no thanksgiving or prayer etc.</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Likely just a transcribed Sermon</li>

  <li>Part of the canon because 3rd/4th century Christians attributed it to Paul</li>

  <li>Themes of Superiority of Christ</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>superior to the prophets - they merely paved the way for Christ</li>
      <li>Superior to the Angels - they are the messengers of God << Son of God</li>
      <li>Superior to Moses - servant in God‚Äôs House, Jesus is God‚Äôs house</li>
      <li>Superior to Joshua - who delivered only temporary peace to Israel, Jesus grants eternal peace</li>
      <li>Superior to the Jewish priesthood - priests are required to mediate between God and Man for human imperfection, they descend from Levi - but Jesus descends from Melchizedek, who was honored by Abraham</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Additionally, priests must repeat sacrifices, Jesus only made a single sacrifice</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Minister of the superior covenant - God says the old covenant is not good enough, Jesus bears the new Covenant</li>
      <li>Superior Tabernacle - Christ raises his sacrifice to heaven whereas the Jewish Law is bound to the Earth</li>
      <li>Superior sacrifice - Perfect, complete, for all sins, one time only</li>
    </ul>
  <li><i>Hebrews</i> author of Jesus is heavily reliant on Judaism if only to elevate Christianity above Judaism</li>
  <li>Argues that jewish law awaits greater fulfillment by God (similar to Matthew)</li>
  <li>Discusses how God makes old covenants obsolete in the Old Testament ‚Üí the same thing happened with the covenant of the Law, obsolete in the face of Jesus‚Äô death and resurrection</li>
  <li>The Old Testament Tabernacle and Jewish Law are inferior shadows of Jesus and the salvation he brings</li>
  <li>Once you have experienced the reality of Christ, there is no turning back, for that is like actualizing Jesus‚Äô crucifixion, and then turning your back to him</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Harsh Old Testament punishments for turning away from the imperfect covenants‚Ä¶ what would happen if you turn away from the perfect covenant: Jesus</li>

  <li>Ends with specific advice against sins like impropriety etc. (the classics)</li>

      <li>Argues that the Law is supposed to inform ethical behavior, not be taken literally</li>
      <li>Some things are literal though, like circumcision ‚Üí prefigured by 318</li>
      <li><b>Gematria</b> - Interpreting words in their numerical value</li>
