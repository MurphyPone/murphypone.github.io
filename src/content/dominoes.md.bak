## Preface

Over 4th of July weekend, I went to hang out with my brother, his wife, and her family.  It was a splendid weekend at the beach, marked by a mid-showing on the links of Hilton Head Island, turning into a raisin on the Pickleball courts, and hours of a devious game designed to tear families apart called _Mexican Train_.  



Recall how much fun at parties.
