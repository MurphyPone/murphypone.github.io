# What / Why?

One of my APUSH high school assignments involved outlining the lives of all the U.S. presidents (omitting the example outline of Washington and president-elect-at-the-time Trump). I found this assignment pretty valuable and have found myself searching back through school Google Drives searching for specific tidbits here and there, so this post resolves that issue by consolidating the multiple assignments into one document for my ease of use.  

This is another post that is more self-serving for myself rather than of interest for other viewers.
